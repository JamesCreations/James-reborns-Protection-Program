A tool I made years ago for myself to generate safe uncrackable passwords and such. Most code is not mine and pulled from various sites including Stackoverflow. The source will be ugly looking as this was put together by me years ago.

To get source running smoothly install this theme : https://www.devcomponents.com/dotnetbar/download.aspx
